# Definitely Not Scorched Earth

This repository contains a tank game heavily inspired by the early 90s video game
[Scorched Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_%28video_game%29).
Full credit to the creators of that original game.

The game was written over a few weeks as a part of SIT102 â€“ Introduction To
Programming at Deakin University.

DNSE is built using [Splashkit](http://www.splashkit.io/): an open source library
designed as a "a beginner's all-purpose software toolkit". I'd highly recommend
you check it out!

## Features

 - interactive main menu
 - game engine (various game states, tanks that shoot each other, hotseat style
gameplay)
 - physics (gravity, projectile trajectory, wind, terrain destruction)
 - computer player AI decision making and memory
 - sound effects, background music
 - randomized elements to improve gameplay (terrain is generated for each game, wind
changes pseudo-randomly over time)

## Design

A design description document is available in the
[design folder](https://github.com/PhilipCastiglione/definitely-not-scorched-earth/tree/master/design)
that details the game architecture along with some of the modeling, types and
processes used to design and build the game.

Probably not! Unless someone really wants me to...

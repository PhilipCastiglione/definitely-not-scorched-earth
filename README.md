# Definitely Not Scorched Earth

This repository contains a tank game heavily inspired by the original early 90s video
game [Scorched Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_%28video_game%29).

The game was written over a few weeks as a part of SIT102 â€“ Introduction To
Programming at Deakin University.

DNSE is built using [Splashkit](http://www.splashkit.io/): an open source library
designed as a "a beginner's all-purpose software toolkit".
